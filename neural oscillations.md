<h1> What are Neural Oscillations? </h1>

Neural oscillations are repetitive, rhythmic synchronized frequency patterns in the central nervous system.
They occur during activation of large clusters of neurons, though they can occur with a single neuron as well.
Although the raw data obtained from  electroencephalograms are formatted as a function of time, neural oscillations are visualized in terms of frequency and measured in units of Hertz (Hz); one cycle per second.
As such the neural clusters generate neural oscillations that can be characterized by the frequency range in which they occur:

List point:
Alpha waves (7.5-12.5 Hz). Alpha waves also contain a subset of waves known as mu waves, which occur in the same frequency range but are correlated to the motor cortex. (Need examples of that these connect to)
Beta waves (13-30 Hz) (need examples of what these connect to)
Delta waves (1-4 Hz) (need examples of what these connect to)
Gamma waves (30-70 Hz) (need examples of what these connect to)
Theta waves (4-8 Hz) (Need examples of what these connect to)

<h1> Why do we produce neural oscillations? </h1>

We do not fully understand why our brain produces neural oscillations.
Some researchers theorize that neural oscillations are nothing more than byproducts of brain activity, indicators of expected brain pattern in response to events of stimulus.
For example, motion produces prdecitable occurrences of alpha waves (in the mu frequency) in the motor cortex,
and sleep cycles are characterized by the alternating flux of different neural waves.
Other researchers have theorized that cetain oscillations, like those that occur in the delta range, are critical to unlocking the mystery of our consciousness. 

<h1> So why do neural oscillations matter? </h1>

Neural oscillations are useful in variety of ways.
From a diagnostic and imaging persepective, they can be used as indicators of specific neurological phenomena such as:
>Sleep and the state of consciousness
>Motor control
>Perception and information processing
>Pattern generation
>Memory
>Abnormal neural function, such as epilepsy, and parkinsons.
