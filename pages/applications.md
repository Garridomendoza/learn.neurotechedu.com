## Virtual Reality
<hr>

Once the stuff of science fiction, virtual reality is on the cusp of becoming part of our day-to-day lives thanks to mounting technological advances. Many popular VR headsets are ushering in exciting new ways to play and interact with the world. As these devices continue to evolve, we believe that EEG algorithms can add the extra layer of immersion needed to truly complete the virtual reality experience.

There are a few companies who have been interested in bring EEG data with VR headsets as seen below.

#### Brain based authentication

EEG Biometric is a growing field which looks at how we can use your eeg activity to be able to identify someone. Similar to one's fingerprint, your brain activity can be used as a form of authentication. The most common forms of Brain Authentication are using resting state brain activity or a visual evoked potential task. For more information on Brain Based Authentication, check out this DEF CON talk.

## Biofeedback Therapy
<hr>

#### Anxiety

Electroencephalography (EEG) feedback, also known as neurofeedback or neurotherapy, was originally developed as a relaxation technique related to meditation (Kamiya, 1969; Michael, Krishnaswamy, & Mohamed, 2005). EEG involves measuring the general patterns of activity of the brain and can be used as a diagnostic assistant (usually via quantitative EEG or qEEG) or feedback tool (Hammond, 2010, 2011). Feedback can be auditory or visual, even in the form of a computer game. In this way, participants learn to regulate specific frequencies of cortical activity. As a feedback therapy, it has been used in many different psychological and medical disorders, including attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and substance use disorder (Myers & Young, 2012). It has also been used to treat the more cognitive components of anxiety disorders and may be more effective in those disorders in which the cognitive experience is central, such as generalized anxiety disorder (Schoenberg & David, 2014). Most practitioners claim there is little to no short-or long-term risk involved in neurofeedback, but some caution that to minimize risk it is critical to individualize treatment using qEEG because of the heterogeneity of EEG presentations of various disorders and comorbidities (Hammond, 2010; Walker, 2010).

#### Sleep Improvement

Sleep research has been using EEG's for a long time. Recently, startups have been leveraging consumer grade eeg designs to measure the quality of your sleep.

#### ADHD

Although a controversial [use case](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/155005940904000311), there are many neurofeedback clinics and few companies who have created solutions to help manage ADHD.

#### PTSD

PTSD neurofeedback has been studied for over [25 years](http://charleston.braincoretherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/PENISTON-PTSD.pdf). A lot of the studies focus on getting the participants to generate alpha wave activity which is associated with being in a relaxed state. Most articles which were reviewed suggest that Neurofeedback should be use in combination with other treatments.

One of the more common services which Neurofeedback clinics provide is neurofeedback to combat brain ageing. Researchers have found that you can identify certain biomarkers in QEEG to predict future cognitive decline as well as the onset of Alzheimer's.

#### Early Development

Most articles looking into the use of EEG as a Neurofeedback tool for early development tends to look at ADHD. However, there might be other use cases as well.

#### Alzheimer’s

A growing body of evidence suggests that EEG analyses, including both resting state and event-related stimulation protocols, may be useful in early detection of neural signatures of dementia [1-6]. Moreover, EEG-based analysis shows potential for discriminating across dementia sub-types, including Alzheimer’s (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Vascular dementias, and the Lewy Body Dementias (LBD) – including Parkinson’s Disease with Dementia (PDD) [1-6]. Although these approaches have been largely confined to university research investigations, if proven accurate, reliable, and scalable, the widespread use of EEG as a neuroimaging modality could provide an inexpensive, easy to implement alternative for early diagnosis and treatment outcome studies of the dementias.

## Neural Prosthetics

#### Robotic Limbs

Physicians and biomedical engineers from Johns Hopkins report what they believe is the first successful effort to wiggle fingers individually and independently of each other using a mind-controlled artificial “arm” to control the movement.

![Brain electrode array](../images/brain-electrode-array.png)

[http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/mind_controlled_prosthetic_arm_moves_individual_fingers_](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/mind_controlled_prosthetic_arm_moves_individual_fingers_)

The US defense force announced that it gave a paralyzed man the ability to 'feel' physical sensations through a prosthetic robotic hand that’s been directly connected to his brain. Having been paralyzed for more than a decade due to a spinal cord injury, the man was able to identify when and which of his prosthetic fingers was being gently touched by an object - and all while blindfolded.

The technology points to a future where people with paralyzed or missing limbs can not only get back the ability to manipulate objects and move about, but can also learn to sense which it is they’re touching.

#### Robot Control

EEG-based brain-controlled mobile robots can serve as powerful aids for severely disabled people in their daily life, especially to help them move voluntarily. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the complete systems, key techniques, and evaluation issues of brain-controlled mobile robots along with some insights into related future research and development issues. We first review and classify various complete systems of brain-controlled mobile robots into two categories from the perspective of their operational modes. We then describe key techniques that are used in these brain-controlled mobile robots including the brain-computer interface techniques and shared control techniques. This description is followed by an analysis of the evaluation issues of brain-controlled mobile robots including participants, tasks and environments, and evaluation metrics. We conclude this paper with a discussion of the current challenges and future research directions.

#### Sensory Prosthetics

There are those who learn to use sound to compensate for their blindness as well as those who are deaf, but “hear” music by feeling its vibrations. Now, the BrainPort V100 takes these concepts to new heights by teaching the tongue to see. The recently FDA-approved device is only one of many new medical innovations attempting to take advantage of our brain’s plasticity — its ability to adapt and relearn new skills — as a way to overcome disabilities.
