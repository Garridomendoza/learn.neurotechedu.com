1 Feature Extraction
## 1.1 What is feature extraction
Raw neural data, recorded from an EEG or other BCI device, includes a broad set of information about brain activity and some noise from external interference. Even with minimal noise, the complexity of the data in its raw form can be difficult to interpret. Feature extraction is the process of identifying and extracting meaningful information from raw neural data. This reduces the noise as well as the volume of data, making it easier to identify patterns and improves the accuracy of the BCI.

Some feature extraction methods are unsupervised. They do not use example data labelled with features to learn from. They simply extract the most significant information on their own by discarding similarities and focusing on the differences in the data. These methods include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Wavelet transform, and more. Other methods like Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) are supervised. They require a set of labelled data to determine the specific patterns you would like to extract.

## 1.2 Which features to extract
The choice of feature extraction methods will depend on several design choices including the type of brain processes being captured. In this document, we will focus on BCIs based on event-related potentials (ERPs).

The feature extraction step for ERP-based BCIs is fairly simple. The first step is to extract epochs. An epoch is a chunk of an EEG signal with a specified length and synchronised with an event (i.e. the presentation of a stimulus). Statistics of these epochs are then computed to extract features. For example, one may  simply compute the mean voltage recorded at each electrode site during the epoch. This feature is usually sufficient for identifying ERPs.

# Event-Related Potential
## __What is an event-related potential__
An event-related potential, or ERP, is the electrophysiological response in the brain
to a specific motor or cognitive event (e.g. a stimulus). This stimulus can be almost
anything: a flashing light, a surprising sound, a blinking eyeld etc. In all cases, a bci
using ERP's will try to isolate and identify these small, event-related responses.

## __How to record an ERP with EEG__

A scalp-recorded EEG records the joint activity of millions of neurons making it almost impossible
to isolate each and every signal that relates to an ERP. The best we can do is look at the 
overall voltage changes. We call a change that appears to reflect a specific psychological 
process an _ERP component_.

An ERP waveform (Figure 1) contains the overall voltage changes over time starting at the onset
of the stimulus. It contains several wave peaks, which could be relevant ERP components. Each positive (P)
and negative (N) peak is followed by a number (i.e. N1, P2, N2, P3, etc.) representing the distance from
the stimulus onset (0 ms). This is the most common naming convention.

## __2.2 How to use ERP's__
BCIs using ERPs are easier to use as they require very little training time. They can be used to monitor
attention and fatigue by studying how the brain reacts to certain external events. With visual stimuli, an
ERP-based BCI can be used as an input device with a relatively quick reaction time compared to other BCI's.

## __How to generate an ERP__
Any sensory, motor or cognitive event can trigger an ERP, but most BCI's using ERPs are
sensory-based and use either visual or auditory stimuli. Both stimuli are more easily generated by a 
computer than other sensory input. Also, the visual cortex has been studied for decades, allowing us
to better interpret visual stimuli on the brain. Sensorimotor stimuli are also used in some BCIs while olfactory and gustatory
stimuli are rarely used.
