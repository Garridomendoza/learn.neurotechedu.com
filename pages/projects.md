teaser: "An easy project for one person might be difficult for someone else. Therefore we have broken down the projects as to either requiring no programming experience (plug and play) or requiring some experience. You will notice that with certain EEG headsets that there is more tutorials than others. This is likely due to the ease of development when using that device. The best way to get started will also depend on the headset that you have available."

#### No Technical Experience

These tools can be used to visualize your brain data:

* [View your brain activity by using Muses's Research Tools](http://developer.choosemuse.com/research-tools/getting-started)
* [View a live topographic map of your brain activity](http://www.brainavatar.com/ebrainavatar-muse.html)
* If you have an Android device, you can take a look at this [EEG 101 Tutorial](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eeg_project&amp;hl=en) which was made by some of the [NeuroTechX community members](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/eeg-101)


#### Some Technical Experience

These are open source projects which require some programming experience in order to implement them:

#### No Technical Experience

*  If you are not comfortable with EEGs or coding, we suggest taking a look at their Getting Started Guide. It includes a link to their [Visualizer software](http://docs.openbci.com/Getting%20Started/00-Welcome)
* This guide uses OpenVibe which is a dataflow programming system and is used for Brain Computer Interfaces. One of the NeuroTechX Community Members [built a P300 Speller using OpenBCI and OpenVibe](http://blog.jfrey.info/2015/02/04/openbci-p300-coadapt/)

#### Some Technical Experience

* [One of the OpenBCI Community members built an alphawave display](http://openbci.com/community/alphawave-openbci-based-demo/)

## No Headset
<hr>

If you don't have a headset available, there are still some stuff you could do with Brain data. Check out some of these sources.

* Want to contribute to open Neuroscience in a gamified way? [Check out Eyewire](http://eyewire.org/explore)
* You can also take a look at a buttload of MRI data [using Brainbox](http://brainbox.pasteur.fr/)
